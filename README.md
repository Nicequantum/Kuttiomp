# Kuttiomp

**A Culturally Sacred Narragansett Language Revitalization Platform**

*Wunnegan — Greetings and respect to all who come to learn.*

## For Knowledge Keepers, Sharente, and Family

Kuttiomp (*family, home, gathering place*) is a language revitalization platform built by a Narragansett tribal member and his family, in partnership with Knowledge Keepers across generations. This platform exists to honor, preserve, and transmit the Narragansett language through the living voices of those who carry it — not as an archive of the past, but as a hearth for the future.

Every word entered into Kuttiomp carries cultural context. Every audio recording is permanently attributed to the speaker whose voice was captured. Every teaching flows through the clan structure that has always governed how knowledge moves: from Grandmother Comus and Grandfather, through Sharente (Two-Spirit keepers), to parents, siblings, and extended clan members.

**This technology serves the language. The language does not serve the technology.**

## Cultural Foundations

### Why Kuttiomp Exists

Narragansett is a living Indigenous language of the Narragansett people, whose homelands encompass present-day Rhode Island and surrounding regions. Language revitalization is an act of **cultural sovereignty** — reclaiming what colonization attempted to sever.

Kuttiomp was designed with these principles:

| Principle | Implementation |
|-----------|----------------|
| **Speaker Attribution** | Every audio recording links to a named speaker |
| **Generational Structure** | Elder → Middle → Younger generation tiers |
| **Clan Organization** | Knowledge organized by clan affiliation |
| **Two-Spirit Honor** | Sharente role explicitly recognized and stewarded |
| **Sacred Content Protection** | Ceremonial knowledge requires elder approval |
| **Living Variation** | Pronunciation variants per speaker are preserved |

### The Name

**Kuttiomp** means family, home, and the gathering place where language is shared. The platform is named for what it aspires to be: not a database, but a home for the language to live among family.

## The Speaker System

Kuttiomp implements a multi-speaker, clan-based knowledge transmission model reflecting the project's founding family:

```
                    ┌─────────────────────┐
                    │  Grandmother Comus  │  Elder · Knowledge Keeper
                    │    (Mush8n8m8s)      │
                    └──────────┬──────────┘
                               │
              ┌────────────────┼────────────────┐
              │                │                │
    ┌─────────▼────────┐  ┌───▼────┐  ┌───────▼───────┐
    │     Mother       │  │ Father │  │   Sharente    │  Two-Spirit Keeper
    └─────────┬────────┘  └────────┘  └───────────────┘
              │
    ┌─────────┴─────────┐
    │                   │
┌───▼──────┐    ┌───────▼──────┐
│  Older   │    │   Younger    │
│ Sibling  │    │   Sibling    │
└──────────┘    └──────────────┘

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+
- Python 3.11+
- npm 10+
- Supabase project (configured)
- Clerk application (configured)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Nicequantum/Kuttiomp.git
cd Kuttiomp

# Install Node dependencies
npm install

# Set up Python backend
cd apps/api
python -m venv .venv

### Environment Variables

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and configure. See `.env.example` for all variables.

## Database Schema

The schema (`supabase/migrations/001_initial_schema.sql`) includes:

### Core Tables

| Table | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `clans` | Clan identity, totem, territory |
| `speakers` | Multi-generational knowledge keepers |
| `cultural_domains` | Knowledge areas (greetings, kinship, ceremony) |
| `lexical_entries` | Words/phrases with cultural context |
| `pronunciation_variants` | Speaker-specific pronunciation |
| `audio_recordings` | Speaker-attributed audio |
| `phrases` | Extended sentence-level content |
| `stories` | Oral tradition records |
| `ai_interactions` | AI assistance audit log |
| `audit_log` | Content governance trail |

### Visibility Levels

Content is governed by visibility:

- `public` — Open educational content
- `clan` — Clan members and enrolled family
- `family` — Immediate family only
- `elders_only` — Requires elder authority
- `sacred` — Restricted ceremonial knowledge

Row Level Security (RLS) enforces these boundaries at the database level.

## Admin Dashboard

The admin dashboard (`apps/admin`) provides:

- **Dashboard** — Overview and cultural protocols
- **Speakers** — Clan tree and speaker profiles
- **Clans** — Clan information and associations
- **Lexicon** — Word/phrase management with cultural context
- **Audio Studio** — Browser-based recording with speaker attribution
- **AI Assistant** — Learning support (not authoritative)
- **Approvals** — Elder review queue

Authentication is handled by Clerk. Only authorized family and clan members should receive accounts.

---

## Cultural Protocols & Governance

### Content Approval Workflow

1. **Create** — Family member adds lexical entry or records audio
2. **Attribute** — Speaker is identified on every recording
3. **Review** — Content enters `pending` or `requires_elder_review` status
4. **Approve** — Knowledge Keeper or Elder approves for publication
5. **Audit** — All changes logged in `audit_log`

### Sacred Content

Content marked `is_sacred: true` or visibility `sacred`:
- Automatically requires elder review
- Never exposed via public API endpoints
- Never used as AI training context
- Access restricted to authorized elders

### AI Usage Policy

The Grok AI integration is a **learning tool only**:
- Does not replace Knowledge Keeper authority
- Does not generate ceremonial content
- All interactions are logged
- Responses include cultural disclaimers

See `docs/CULTURAL_PROTOCOLS.md` for complete protocols.
